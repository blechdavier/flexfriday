start
- crafting bench 
- storage hub

storage hub (maybe called storage vault)
- upgrades
- capacity (is the limitation of capacity in stacks or in item total)
    - item total -> stored in an array format: [item1count, item2count, item3count, etc...]
    - stacks -> or could be an array of ItemStacks

drone ai
- update every tick
- searching
    - loop through every tree in the world?? seems expensive
    - if closest tree distance>some number of tiles, destination is storage hub
    - destinationCoords: [x, y]; destination: Number;  this number is the index in the world.worldTiles array that the destination can be found at
- cutting
    - if this.inventory full, destination is storage hub
    - if this.world.worldTiles[destination].woodCount === 0 && if this.world.worldTiles[destination].seedCount === 0, drone.state = searching
- waiting for storage hub to be empty
- returning to storage hub
- depositing (do in one frame why the hell not)

- probably needs to have a boolean called destinationIsTree to avoid checking the woodCount of the storage hub


drill ai
- update every 5 ticks?
- in an ore deposit, loop through every tile of air and for each, if a random number is more than 0.95, add a tile of that ore
- if the drill's range (maybe a circle stored in a list on the object for simplicity) includes a tile of a metal it can break, check the storage hub if it can accept it, and break it if it can


ladders (tile)
- controls have no acceleration or jumping (textures done, not a tileset yet) (not important)


TODO make the arrows of the controls menu left and right instead of up and down to make it seem more fluid UX
- add page counter label text

maybe try adding mobile support (not that important)
- joystick
- click hotbar slot to switch (good to do anyway probably)
